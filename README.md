# ClearScore test

## Things I would have done with more time

### Animated the text transitions after getting the backend data. 

Right now, the transitions are too abrubt, not a good UX.

### Added a refresh mechanism

### Would have loved to have added the percentage bar with Core Graphics
But didn't have time to do so
